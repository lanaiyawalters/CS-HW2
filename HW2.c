    FINAL       : 63.00
    ------------------------------------
    OVERALL AVERAGE : 75.09
    (75.50*.2 + 63.20*.2 + 100.00*.05 + (78.00+90.00+63.00)*.55/3 is 75.09)

    Good-bye!

    If yes - start over from top
    If score or letter incorrectly entered - give 3 tries then terminate run (float between 0-100 or Y,y,n,N)
    All grades between 0-100
    All average scores need to be declared as floats
